# Project Ophiolite

Unveiling Python's inner workings, we craft tools that transform the art of coding into a live spectacle.

We are working on tools and libraries that:

- **Monitor and visualize code execution**: No need to guess what's happening in your code. Watch it live.
- **Break the rules of Python**: Goto anywhere, customize syntax, change your code on the fly. Make Python dance to your tune.

> [!NOTE] 
> _This project is in its early stages. We are still exploring the possibilities and experimenting with different ideas. If you are interested, please reach out to us. We would love to hear your thoughts and ideas._

## Project overview
_This is an easteregg :P_

`Along`: Real-time code execution monitoring and visualization.
`Blackmagics`: Goto anywhere, customize syntax, change your code on the fly... code in the most treacherous ways.

`Among`: The very library to see and control your code.
`Mutability`: A runtime bytecode modifier implemented using PEP523.
`Cyntaxide`: !DANGER! Use hooks to force cpython to ignore syntax errors.
